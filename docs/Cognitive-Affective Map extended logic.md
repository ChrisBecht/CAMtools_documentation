Define your config file
------------

Within the administrative panel after you have logged in you can click on "Design a CAM" (blue botton top right). After you have drawn your default CAM, which should be presented to the participants (see details in [Set up study](Set up study.md)) you can click on the "gear symbol" (top left) to define the configuration of your CAM study. 


**Parameter you can change using the user interface:** 

| Parameter   |      Meaning      |  Possible values |
|----------|:-------------|:------:|
| #ConNumNodes    | Number of nodes a participant needs to draw before <br> she / he is can save the CAM. | 1-50<sup>1</sup> |
| #MaxLengthWords | Maximum number of words allowed for each concept.   |  1-5<sup>2</sup> |
| #MaxLengthChars | Maximum number of characters for each concept allowed. | 30-300 |
| #hideArrows | If ON possible to draw draw arrows / directed connections. | ON / OFF |
| #showOnlyPosSlid | If ON possible to draw supporting connections. | ON / OFF |
| #hideAmbivalent | If ON possible to draw ambivalent concepts. | ON / OFF |
| #cameraFeature | If ON  an splotlight feature is included to move the drawing <br> screen. If participants move their mouse to the edges the <br> drawing screen is moved to the respective side. | ON / OFF |
| #fullScreen | If ON study is set to fullscreen mode and paradata is <br> collected (defocus, focus events). | ON / OFF |
| #setLanguage | Set the language of the C.A.M.E.L. interface: | English, <br> German, <br> Spanish |


<sup>1</sup>Maxmimum number is restricted, because the drawing space is limited. In the future 3D environments will be implemented.

<sup>2</sup>It is **highly recommened to set this value to 1-3** if you are aiming to summarize / aggregate the CAM data. Instruct participants to avoid writing sentences and to draw instead multiple concepts. 

*Remark: It is no recommended to write directly into the config file. Certain configurations are set to default values and should not be changed.*
