CAM-App
=====

There are two **possibilities to run the CAM-App**:

* locally: 
    * download the CAM-App from the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysis" target="_blank">https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysisR</a> (use <code>.git</code> or download it manutally -> green button "<>Code" -> "Download ZIP")
    * if not already installed, download <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>
    * open the file <code>app.R</code>, install packages if needed, click on "Run App"
* online (! disadvantage: App is slower): 
    * open the link: <a href="https://fennapps.shinyapps.io/CAMtools_CAMapp/" target="_blank">https://fennapps.shinyapps.io/CAMtools_CAMapp/</a>
    
<br>

Within the CAM app you are **guided and within every implemented module** (see below) you have module specific information ("> Information" button in the sidebar panel). The single modules / functionalities are explained in more detail below with specific examples. 
<br>
If you want **to change or extend single functions**, please check out the readme file of the folder "additional scripts" in the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysis/tree/main/additional%20scripts" target="_blank">https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysis/tree/main/additional%20scripts</a>
