Cognitive-Affective Maps
=====

What are Cognitive-Affective Maps?
------------

Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) are a quantitative and qualitative research method and first became popular through Thagard in 2010[@thagard_empathica_2010]. Using CAMs it is possible to identify, visually represent and analyze existing belief structures or any kind of declarative knowledge. Using our developed software [Cognitive-Affective Map *extended logic*](Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic.md) participants can draw within online studies their own CAM and the resulting data can be preprocessed and analyzed by the developed [CAM-App](CAM-App.md). CAM incorporates so-called affective valences by representing whether a person associates positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent emotions with a drawn concept. Furthermore, it is possible to specify the connections in different strengths and dashed lines stand for inhibitory connections and solid lines stand for strengthening connections. Additionally CAMs contain directional arrows, which represent a directional effect. Thus, CAMs represent a weighted directional network with a simple graph structure and can be analyzed by means of network analysis in addition to more common quantitative as well as qualitative analyses. The different elements of a CAM are concepts (also called nodes), which are linked by connectors (also called edges):

In the following example CAM, participants compared cars and public transport[@sendtner_kostbare_2021] (click on CAM to enlarge it in new tab):

What are the reasons to use Cognitive-Affective Maps?
----------------

CAMs have a strong theoretical foundation and have been discussed within philosophy (mainly in the context of explanatory coherence) since the end of the 1990s[@thagard_ethical_1998, @thagard_coherence_2000]. It is assumed that concepts within CAMs are are only changed or added if these concepts correspond to the „most coherent account of what we want to understand“. This drawing process of CAMs is understood as a **constraint satisfaction problem** and multiple mathematical models, like the *hot cognition* (HOTCO) model[@thagard_hot_2006], were proposed. Since 2020[@thagard_hot_2006] in the University of Freiburg within the Departement of Experimental Psychology, CAM tools for large online-studies are under development.


The relevance of CAMs as a research method in its own right could be reflected in the method’s multiple fields of application, which are linked to multiple interesting research question: 

**Research questions already investigated** (*remark: incomplete list*):

* In two emperical studies it was explored how people (in different countries) are perceiving the COVID-19 pandemic[@mansell_novel_2021, @reuter_leisure_2021]
* The proposed HOTCO model has been applied in the context of agent-based modelling[@wolf_changing_2015, @schroder_modeling_2017]
* CAMs have been applied to study political belief systems[@homer-dixon_complex_2013, @homer-dixon_conceptual_2014] !Milkoreit2013 
* The potentiality of CAMs for conflict mediation was investigated !Gros2021
* If CAMs add value to survey studies has been qualitatively investigated !Dör2021
* CAMs have been applied to  knowledge about the cost of cars impact the perception of environmentally friendly mobility? (Michael Stumpf)






**Research questions currently under investigation:**

* What are key-psychological factors influencing the acceptance of yet fictitious technologies? (Julius Fenn, Jessica Helm)

* How researchers from different disciplines do understand the concept “life”? (Sabrina Livanec , Philipp Höfele)


* As CAMs are an exploratory tool, this may allow us to go beyond predefined standardized surveys to identify possible interrelationships within belief systems that would otherwise not have been identified (Livanec et al., 2020; Mansell et al., 2021). 


Can CAMs be used to identify ethical principles underlying the evaluation of bioinspired technologies? (Lisa Reuter, Philipp Höfele)

How can CAM help in value-sensitive design and human-centered engineering approaches (especially in human-machine collaboration)? (Sabrina Livanec)

; possible to identify and visually represent
any kind of declarative knowledge:

The `kind` parameter should be either `"meat"`, `"fish"`, or `"veggies"`.

For example:

```python
>>> import lumache
>>> lumache.get_random_ingredients()
['shells', 'gorgonzola', 'parsley']
```
